# Thrill Tracker Backend

This project is a RESTful API built with Express and Knex for my thrill-tracker project. This project is still a work in progress and the plan is for it to handle many users and the ride data can be customized/crowd sourced by the user base.

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with npm install and then use npm run start. You will need to declare a port in a .env as PORT or it will default to port 1234.
