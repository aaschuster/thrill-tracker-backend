# Thrill Tracker Backend

This project is a RESTful API built with Express and Knex for my thrill-tracker project. This project is still just in the beginning stages of being built but the plan is for it to handle many users and the ride data can be customized/crowd sourced by the user base. 

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with npm install and then use npm run start. You will need to declare a port in a .env as PORT or it will default to port 1234.
